						<h1>Demanding excellence for generations.</h1><br><br>

						<p><strong>Our business began how we mean for it to continue: with a passion for finding a better way. As a family company, Pitt Meadows Plumbing was founded on the same principles we stand by almost four decades later. We believe integrity and knowledge are the most valuable currency, and that innovative thinking is the way forward.</strong></p><br>

						<p><strong>As a local company, our expertise in plumbing and heating is reflective of life on the west coast of Canada. However, our progressive approach was inspired by cutting-edge European innovations. Itâ€™s this forward thinking that we have passed down for generations in the Pitt Meadows family, and has led to the continuous success of our clients and partners.</strong></p>
