						<h1>Darryl Kleckner</h1><br>
						<p>With a background in sales and estimation, Darryl draws on over a decade of experience in the plumbing and heating industry. Since joining the Pitt Meadows team in March 2015 he has assisted a number of new project bids. His other responsibilities include estimating plumbing jobs both big and small, and purchasing major equipment. Outside the office, Darrylâ€™s focus turns from the plumbing industry to family and baseball. As a lover of both, he can be found playing with his two sons and teaching them everything they need to know about the sport, or being cheered on as he takes the field with his slo-pitch team.</p>
